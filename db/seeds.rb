#New Thai Elephant
review0 = Review.create!(content: "We dined  outside during the pandemic. It was a nice little set up. I like that the menu offers variety, but not an overwhelming amount of options.  The service was decent, not exceptional.
I had the iced honey green tea and vegetarian spring rolls. The green tea had a very floral taste, almost Jasmine. I enjoyed my tea and spring rolls very much. The spring rolls are a light refreshing meal, the mint makes it wonderful on a hot day. I will say that they weren't very generous with the tofu, and that was a disappointment.
My friend had the chicken satay and mango shrimp salad. The chicken was pretty good. She said the salad was great. I had some of her Thai iced tea, that was delicious! Really sweet, but definitely a winner. My other friend had Thai iced coffee, and reported that it wasn't remarkable in any way.
I'm glad we tried this place and I'd come back here again. The ramen looked tempting, but it was too hot for soup.",

review13 = Review.create!(content: "A little bit pricey but absolutely amazing service & taste!!!

Interior - they have plenty of outdoor seating during COVID, and so glad that I made my first stop of eating out here since the pandemic happened. The restaurant is right in the corner of 4th, in the heart of downtown San Mateo

Service - I asked the server if we could get everything in to go containers just to be safe, and he happily agreed and offered top notch service. Food comes out really quickly too. The ambience is also great with outdoor music.

Taste - really good Thai food, portion is decent as well. Everything we ordered was better than what we expected, Crispy Pork and Pineapple fried rice were both really tasty and definitely recommend!",

I was interested in retrying this place and I ordered the crab fried rice again. It was a little disappointing - dry and not very flavorful. I also would have preferred more cilantro or green onion.

I would come back and give their other items a try if I was in the area. They are located on a corner in downtown. Street parking is available and we were able to snag a spot easily in the afternoon.",

#One Waan
review2 = Review.create!(content: "One Waan is a solid restaurant with exceptional service. Love coming here for Thai staples and occasionally branch out into other dishes. The dishes are always beautifully arranged and colorful. I feel like their portions are generous and reasonably priced, and some of their dishes are great if you don't want a bunch of carbs. I like the red curry and the corn fritters a lot, and their cocktails are unique and very tropical.

The service here really shines. During the SIP they have a clear system and very fast and easy pickup/online ordering. Definitely call or use their website rather than app delivery - the service seems to be a lot faster.",

And really, what more could you ask for?

The Mango Sticky Rice was the star of the show.  This featured perfectly ripe slices of mango beautifully wrapped around a mound of pink sticky rice and garnished with fruit bits and coconut sauce.  

We also enjoyed their One Waan House Crackling Salad (loved their crispy shrimp chips, but would opt to add chicken or shrimp to it next time to make it more filling) and their Volcanic Beef (another artistically plated beauty w/ tender chunks of well-flavored beef).

Everything was delicious and we are looking forward to coming back for more dishes!",

Tom Yum was delicious, very lemon grassy not too sour. My favorite Tom Yum in SF.

I came across quesabirra tacos on IG and was curious to see if there were any close by to my work. Quesabirria is a combo of cheese and birria, which is a traditional Mexican Stew. Usually comes with consome or beef broth for dippin. It was mandatory for me to try it. Browsed yelp for places that served up birria and El Patron popped up; I bookmarked them so hard.", user_id: u2.id, business_id: b3.id, rating: 4)
review26 = Review.create!(content: "I tried this place a few times. Both times the food was great. My favorites are the el taco patron specials; shrimp and the Berria tacos. I also tried carne asada, mulito and chicken tacos however the chicken was my least favorite. I'll have to checkout the pleasant hill location closer to my house as there were a few things I disliked about this location. Both times I placed my order I was told 15mins but the order wasn't ready for another 15/20 mins after arrival. Also very difficult speaking with the ladies on both occasions.

review30 = Review.create!(content: "Hands down my favorite taco joint in San Francisco (pre & post COVID). Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is one of the few, if not the only restaurant in SF that serves birria tacos -- and they are delicious! The beef stew meat and broth on the side go so well together (remember to add the cheese!) The flavors are intense but not too overwhelming. Another plus: these are HUGE tacos; I can only eat 3 at a time.",

review32 = Review.create!(content: "I ordered the matcha latte with less ice, 50% sweetness, and oat milk. I'm always a big fan of any boba shop that has oat milk, cause it tastes exactly like milk and has the same creaminess, but is lactose free! I'm actually very impressed by the matcha flavor. It had a strong matcha flavor that wasn't overpowered by the milk and the perfect sweetness.", user_id: u6.id, business_id: b5.id, rating: 4)

Brew Cha offers your classic boba drinks, and also more unique drinks, such as their Ube Taro Latte (15oz/$5.50; Swapped black boba for white, yelp.com/user_local_phot‚Ä¶). It normally comes with black boba but I swapped it for their white, which was nice and chewy- very unique! The taro flavor in the latte was really good, but it was a little too creamy overall. However, it's definitely worth trying once. I hope to come back and try their other drinks!

So, the boba may have been meh, but since it's called Brew Cha (cha is Chinese for tea), perhaps I'll go back to try the fruit teas instead!", user_id: u1.id, business_id: b5.id, rating: 4)

#House of Prime rib
review5 = Review.create!(content: "A short while back I decided to have a baby. A meat baby. The procedure was simple: make a reservation, show up, get seated, start meating. Prime rib was the special, though there were seafood options as well. The sides, like creamed spinach and Yorkshire pudding, were all delicious. Medication (wine) was affordable and the manhattans overflowed. The staff were wonderful and the restaurant had classic charm.", user_id: u5.id, business_id: b6.id, rating: 5)

I didn't come all the way from Hawaii to not have the King Cut which was the largest serving and includes the bone. My server said hey..don't worry you can always take the left overs..hahaha...leftovers. Each meal comes with a salad prepared table side, yorkshire pudding, mashed/baked potato, and creamed spinach. Instead of the potato I was able to get a serving of their creamed corn which was excellent. Prime Rib was amazingly tender and delicious and I was able to finish of that piece with no problem, probably because I skipped the potato. For dessert, of course a second cut of meat! You can also get additional sides with your second cut but I just needed the meat which was the star!", user_id: u2.id, business_id: b6.id, rating: 5)

We started off with warm bread with a side of butter and a large plate of salad. Our prime rib came out along with a side of creamed corn, Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. The prime rib was just heavenly! It was soft and full of flavor. I was honestly very surprised and the sides were delicious.

My favorite part about this place is the amazing bread rolls they serve. They are ready to give you lots, but save room for the oysters and other dishes!
I always get the Mixed Oyster plate to have a variety to try. I wanted to get the Pesto Mussel dish that I had last time, but this is not longer on the menu I found. I was able to split a bowl of Clam Chowder which was delicious and so beautiful! Splitting it was perfect, along with oysters and bread for two people.", user_id: u2.id, business_id: b7.id, rating: 4)

Their taro milk tea isn't the best and not even in the top 5. The four seasons milk tea was roasted oolong which was pretty good. The Mochi soy milk was different and interesting and definitely looked pretty.
